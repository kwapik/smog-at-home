# Smog @ Home

Smog @ Home is a simple software for SDS011 sensor which includes:
* UART client
* Simple Flask app

## How to install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

```bash
python app.py
```

## TODO
* Support all SDS011 commands - for now it is working all the time. Switching it
to sleep mode between measurments will be convenient
* Some graphs - d3?
